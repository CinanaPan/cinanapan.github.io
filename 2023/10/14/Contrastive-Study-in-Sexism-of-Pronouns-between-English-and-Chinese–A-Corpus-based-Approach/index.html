<p>Pronouns are also related to sexism, which is the discrimination or prejudice based on one’s gender or sex. Sexism can be manifested in language use, such as the choice, frequency, or variation of pronouns. English and Chinese are two major languages in the world, but they have different linguistic features and cultural backgrounds that may affect the pronoun use and sexism. For example, English has a gender distinction in pronouns (he&#x2F;she&#x2F;they), while Chinese does not have a gender distinction in spoken language but has different written forms for pronouns (他&#x2F;她&#x2F;它). Therefore, it is interesting and important to compare and contrast the pronoun use and sexism between English and Chinese from various perspectives, such as linguistic, social, historical, or psychological.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to use a corpus approach to investigate the pronoun use and sexism between English and Chinese in different types of texts and contexts. A corpus approach is a method that uses large collections of authentic texts or speech to analyze the linguistic features and patterns of language use. By using a corpus approach, this study can obtain quantitative and qualitative data on the frequency, distribution, variation, or change of pronouns and other related words or structures in English and Chinese. This study can also explore the factors that influence the pronoun choice and variation, such as the genre, register, domain, time period, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, ethnicity, class, region, etc. of the speakers or writers. Moreover, this study can examine the effects of pronoun use and sexism on the communication and cognition of the readers or listeners. This study can also provide some implications and suggestions for the translation, teaching, learning, or policy-making of English and Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>Research questions</strong></p>
<p>This proposed study attempts to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How frequently are gendered pronouns used in different genres and domains of English and Chinese texts, and how does this frequency compare to other languages that have different linguistic features and cultural backgrounds?</li>
<li>What are the most common collocates or modifiers of gendered pronouns in English and Chinese texts, and how do they reflect or reinforce the stereotypes or biases about women and men in different contexts?</li>
<li>How do the gendered pronouns co-refer or agree with the antecedents or the predicates in English and Chinese texts, and how does this affect the coherence or clarity of the communication?</li>
<li>How do the speakers or writers and the readers or listeners perceive or evaluate the use of gender-neutral or inclusive pronouns in English and Chinese texts, and what are the factors that influence their preferences or attitudes?</li>
<li>How has the use of gendered pronouns changed over time in English and Chinese texts, and what are the historical events, cultural influences, or language contact that have triggered or facilitated these changes?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Literature Review (Research background and problems)</strong></p>
<p>Pronouns are one type of linguistic unit that can pose challenges for equivalence, especially when they are used to convey gender information or identity. Different languages may have different systems of gender marking in their pronouns, such as binary (masculine&#x2F;feminine), ternary (masculine&#x2F;feminine&#x2F;neuter), or non-binary (singular&#x2F;plural). Moreover, different languages may have different preferences or norms for using pronouns in different contexts, such as academic writing, media discourse, or everyday conversation.</p>
<p>Chinese and English are two typologically distinct languages that have different pronoun systems and usage patterns. Chinese has a non-binary system of pronouns, which means that there is no grammatical distinction between masculine and feminine forms. The same character 他 can be used to refer to both ‘he’ and ‘she’, depending on the context. However, since the 20th century, a new character 她 has been introduced to represent ‘she’ explicitly, especially in written texts. English, on the other hand, has a binary system of pronouns, which means that there is a grammatical distinction between masculine and feminine forms. The pronouns ‘he’ and ‘she’ are used to refer to male and female referents respectively.</p>
<p> One of the current trends of pronoun usage in contemporary English is the rise of non-binary pronouns, such as the singular they&#x2F;them and other forms like ze&#x2F;zir or ey&#x2F;em. These pronouns are used by some people who identify as neither male nor female, or both, or somewhere along the gender spectrum. Using these pronouns is a way of respecting and affirming their gender identity and expression. in contemporary Chinese is the emergence and acceptance of new gender-neutral pronouns, such as TA (他&#x2F;她&#x2F;它), TA (TA), and ZI (子). These pronouns are used by some people who do not identify with the traditional binary gender system of male and female, or who want to avoid specifying their gender in certain contexts. Using these pronouns is a way of expressing and respecting their gender diversity and fluidity. This new gender-neutral pronouns have gained popularity among young Chinese netizens, especially those who belong to the LGBTQ+ community or support gender equality. The article also mentions that the new pronouns have been adopted by some celebrities, media outlets, and online platforms in China, as well as some dictionaries and textbooks.</p>
<p>The contrastive studies on sexism of pronouns between Chinese and English aim to explore how the two languages deal with the representation and expression of gender in their pronoun systems and usage patterns. They also examine how the cultural and social factors influence the choice and frequency of pronouns in different genres and domains. Most of the corpus-based contrastive studies on sexism have focused on English and Chinese as the main languages of comparison in a small range of discourse analysis. There is a need for more studies that include other corpora or varieties to provide a more comprehensive and diachronic image of sexism across culture. </p>
<p>Those studies have used existing corpora or created their own corpora based on specific criteria or genres. There is a need for more studies that use specialized comparable corpora that are designed to capture the linguistic features and variations of translated and non-translated texts. Most of the corpus-based contrastive studies on sexism have adopted a descriptive or quantitative approach to analyze the data. There is a need for more studies that use a more interpretive approach to explain the results and relate them to the underlying cognitive and ideological factors that shape the use of sexism in pronouns.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<p>Some corpus-based methodologies are methods that use large collections of authentic texts (corpora) to analyze the linguistic patterns and usage of pronouns in different varieties and genres of English and Chinese. Some examples of these methods are:</p>
<p>Frequency analysis: This is a method of counting and comparing the occurrence of pronouns in different texts or subcorpora, such as translated vs. non-translated texts, or spoken vs. written texts. Frequency analysis can reveal the general trends and preferences of pronoun usage in different contexts and domains. For example, a study by Yan and Li (Yan G., &amp; Li Y, 2006) found that English tends to employ consistently more pronouns in every genre than Chinese, but the distributional patterns of pronouns in the two languages across the genres are highly correlated, suggesting that pronouns can play similar functional roles in varying contextual situations.</p>
<p>Collocation analysis: This is a method of identifying and measuring the co-occurrence of pronouns with other words or phrases, such as verbs, nouns, or adjectives. Collocation analysis can reveal the semantic and pragmatic associations and constraints of pronouns in discourse.</p>
<p>Concordance analysis: This is a method of displaying and examining the surrounding context of pronouns in texts, usually in the form of key word in context (KWIC) lines. Concordance analysis can reveal the syntactic and semantic functions and meanings of pronouns in relation to their antecedents, referents, or predicates. For example, a study by Jiang (Jiang X, 2018) compared the use of first-person pronouns by native speakers of English and Chinese in academic English writing across four disciplines, and revealed that there are significant differences between the two groups in terms of frequency, distribution, and functions of first-person pronouns, which may reflect different cultural and rhetorical preferences.</p>
